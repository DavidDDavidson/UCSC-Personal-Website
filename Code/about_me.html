                <p>
                  I was born and raised in the East San Francisco Bay Area. I've
                  always had an interest in computers from and early age but
                  never expected to make a career out of it.<br>
                  I've also really had an interest in competative PC games. When
                  I was younger I really enjoyed playing Everquest, Starcraft,
                  and Day of Defeat. As of late I've been really interested in
                  Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Starcraft 2. <br>
                  My interest in PC games naturally led me to have interests in
                  PC's themselves. That is, in building them. I have extensive
                  experience in building personal computers and frequently
                  follow the newest and fastest components, usually CPU's and
                  GPU's. I'm really fascinated in how technology evolves.<br>
                  I'm also really interested in computer security, although I
                  really am a novice. I try to learn as much as I can on my
                  spare time and hope to one day specialize in computer
                  security.
