                <p>
                  I highly recommend using <b>CodeCademy</b> to learn about new
                  webtechnologies, API's and various programming languages.
                  <b>CodeCademy</b> offers free courses on all these subjects
                  and you can learn at your own pace. I learned how code in
                  <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> using <b>CodeCademy</b> as well as
                  how to use the basic features of <b>Bootstrap</b>.<br>

                <h3><b><i>HackerRank</i></b></h3>
                <p>
                  <b>HackerRank</b> is a site specifically for those wanting
                  to practice their programming skills. <b>HackerRank</b>
                  offers hundreds of programming challenges and frequent
                  programming challenge contests where you can compete with
                  many hackers on the site. Solving challenges gives your
                  profile points for which can aid you to increase in rank.<br>

                  What I've found most helpful about <b>HackerRank</b> is that
                  the challenges recquire you to consider runtime to recieve
                  the maximum number of points for a given challenge—you can't
                  use a bruteforce solution for everything. Thus, the site
                  forces you to always consider the efficiency of your
                  programs—which is generally good practice and a soughtout
                  skill in the software industry.<br>
