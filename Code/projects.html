                  A repository containing solutions to programming challenges
                  and contests from the website
                  <a href="http://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>.
                  The programming challenges will typically require runtime analysis
                  to be considered complete. In otherwords, a bruteforce solution will
                  not suffice as a complete solutionâ€”code must be optimized.

                  Most of my code is written in C++, but I also write solutions in
                  Java and Python as these three are my main languages. Sometimes
                  solutions will be written in other languages.

                    HackerRank is a site for hackers from all over the world to
                    solve programming problems in different CS domains like
                    algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence,
                    and to excel in different programming paradigms like
                    functional programming.

                  My personal website (this site) showcasing my abilities in web
                  applications. My website is made using <b>Twitter</b>'s
                  <b>Bootstrap</b> front-end frame work, however much of the
                  aethetic is custom made by overriding <b>Bootstrap</b>'s
                  CSS files. The code for this site can be found below.

                  This project is currently in the early works. I'm still coming
                  up with ideas of what to do. However, I know for sure that I
                  want to use <b>MIT</b>'s <a href="http://ionicframework.com"><b>Ionic</b></a>
                  framework since it is cross-platform and allows for apps to
                  built quickly using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
